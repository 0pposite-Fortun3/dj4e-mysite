# This is a a file that I am actively working on in the DJ4E course with csev. I just wanted to upload the files, so I could access them easily from multiple devices and look at them when needed.
# Hopefully there will be people that need help figuring stuff out while also learning how to use Django and I would be more than happy to help anyone in anyway that I could in their journey.
# "Cheers"
